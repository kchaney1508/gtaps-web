        <strong>Previous Objective</strong>
        <span>We just finished the website and Discord bot, which locked in the public-facing site, base layout and the first-pass onboarding flow.</span>
      </div>

      <div class="brief-note-strip">
        <strong>Current Objective</strong>
        <span>Right now, we're focused on building the in-game framework, policing system, callouts and importing assets. This can be a lengthy process and could take up to three or more months.</span>

      <strong>Content and Assets</strong>
      <span>This includes vehicles, buildings, texture changes and audio files. We also need to ensure everything complies with Rockstar's ToS while keeping the experience fun.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="brief-rail">
      <strong>Character Framework</strong>
      <span>Our foundation for player data such as characters and saved settings. Once stable, we'll be able to expand our Mobile Data Terminal without breaking everything each update.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="brief-rail">
      <strong>Callouts and Policing</strong>
      <span>Covers callouts, traffic stops, dispatch flow, AI behaviors and report handling. The goal is believable scenarios that stay smooth and fair.</span>
